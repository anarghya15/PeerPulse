We have created an online web platform, Peerpulse, designed to facilitate peer feedback and grading sessions in a classroom setting. The platform offers a number of features geared towards streamlining the feedback process, which is traditionally a logistically overwhelming task that is typically done manually or via tedious forms. One key feature of the website is the ability for instructors to create courses and form groups for each course. Students can then sign up using a course code or an invite link from the platform. This allows for easy management of multiple courses and groups, and ensures that only registered students are able to access the feedback system.
